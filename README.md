# AndroidTipCalculator
Learning project for JetBrains Academy.  
This demonstrates usage of the following controls:
* EditText
* Material Design Discrete Slider
* TextView

In addition, event listeners are hooked up to respond to user input.

The course required certain hard-coded control names and layout.
Simple functional app that allows one to enter the bill amount and desired tip percent, on any change of inputs the tip amount is recalculated and displayed.

I added hint text to the EditText control (for the bill amount)

Code is clean and has 0 warnings in Android Studio.
